# Endless Escapade - v0.1
> Beta

The initial release of the mod will feature plenty of mechanic reworks and new content. Despite not aiming to implement the Seamap and its islands, the version will still allow for players to feel what the mod envisions so far.

---

## Mechanics

The mod may or may not eventually rework many of the game's mechanics depending on whether it will benefit us or not. For now, swimming and arrow transformations are one of them.

### Swimming
The new swimming rework will completely modify the way the mechanic currently works by introducing omnidirectional movement, which consequently provides far more exploration and locomotion. Visually, the arms and legs of the player will also be adjusted to match the movement.

#### Attributes
* Oxygen capacity: represents how long the player can stay underwater.
* Oxygen breathing efficiency: represents how long the player's oxygen is decreased.

#### Accessories
* Small Air Tank: Increases oxygen capacity by 10 seconds.
* Standard Air Tank: Increases oxygen capacity by 20 seconds.
* Large Air Tank: Increases oxygen capacity by 40 seconds.
* Ultra-Large Air Tank: Increases oxygen capacity by 60 seconds.
* Flippers: Provides greater turn velocities and greater movement speed underwater.
* Rebreather: Increases oxygen breathing efficiency by 100%.

#### Potions
* Gills Potion: Increases oxygen breathing efficiency by 100%.

### Arrow transformations
