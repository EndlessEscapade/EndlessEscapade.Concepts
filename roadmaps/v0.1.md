# 1. Introduction
The initial release of the mod will feature plenty of mechanic reworks and new content.

# 2. Mechanics
The mod may or may not eventually rework many of the game's mechanics depending on whether it will benefit us or not. For now, swimming, arrow transformations and shell pile extractination are some of them.

## 2.1 Swimming
The new swimming rework will completely modify the way the mechanic currently works by introducing omnidirectional movement, which consequently provides far more exploration and locomotion. Visually, the arms and legs of the player will also be adjusted to match the movement.

## 2.3 Shell Pile extractination
[Shell Piles](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Shell_Pile) can now be used in an [Extractinator](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Extractinator) and will have the same loot pool as the [Desert Fossil](https://terraria.wiki.gg/wiki/Desert_Fossil), with the exception of including a wide variety of new gear and accessories.

* **Jellyfish Bulb:** Found by killing any kind of jellyfish with a 2% drop chance. This gives the player a small aura, equivalent to 10 blocks in all directions.

## 4.7 Sports

### 4.7.1 Gliders
Gliders provide players with a movement style similar to wings, allowing for gliding across the terrain. Unlike traditional wings, gliders offer a distinct visual appearance, closely resembling actual gliders from real life. This unique design enhances the experience of soaring through the skies while maintaining a different aesthetic from standard wing options. - ✔️

## 4.8 Shipyard
The Shipyard serves as the primary focus of the mod, where your journey on the Seamap begins. Here, you will meet the Sailor, who will assist you in starting your adventure. - ✔️

### 4.8.1 Generation
The Shipyard is guaranteed to generate on the left side of the world, specifically located at the [Beach](https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/Ocean). Initially, you will find the Sailor's house, a deck, and a broken sailboat waiting for you. - ✔️

### 4.8.2 Sailor
The Sailor is an essential character within the mod and the Shipyard. By interacting with him, you can repair the broken sailboat, enabling your journey to the Seamap. Additionally, he offers the ability to create and customize various attachments and upgrades for your boat, enhancing your travel experience. - ❌

### 4.8.3 Sailboat
The Sailboat is your means of traveling to the Seamap. It is both upgradeable and customizable, giving players ample control over their vessel. Initially, the sailboat is broken but can be repaired with the help of the Sailor using the following materials:
* **Wood**: 200 pieces.
* **Silk**: 20 pieces.
* **Money**: 5 gold coins.

## 4.9 Seamap
### 4.9.1 Terrain
Unlike the previous version of the seamap, which introduced a pretty appealing but nonetheless vague terrain, the new seamap will introduce large portions of land - that may be refered to as continents - which will hold plenty of the mod's biomes, while still having plentiful of archipelagos around that may hold specific biomes as well. - ❌

## 4.9.2 Labels
Another poorly designed feature in the previous seamap was the lack of orientation to the player. To fix this, labels would be inserted into the map itself, providing names of regions and common locations.

Labels by default could be marked as "???", then have their name revealed after completing an event, such as travelling to the region, interacting with town NPCs, etc. - ❌

> Example

![Seamap](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1uO_kTykg.jpg)

## 4.9.3 Markers
> Concept by Citrus

Providing the players a way to mark a location they've already been to in the seamap is crucial to make exploration viable. Buoys are a new item that allow the player to do so by deploying them in the seamap.

Crafted from [Silk](https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/Silk) at a [Workbench](https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/Work_Benches), buoys can have their name, color, and position changed by the player. If the player has accidentally placed a buoy or is not satisfied with its attributes, they may just pick it back up and re-deploy it as they please. - ❌
## 4.9.4 Anchoring
The sailboat is generally available to be anchored at any point of the seamap, allowing for the player to explore every bit of it. Each region is procedurally generated per world, meaning they can come back to it at a later point with the same state.

This may also introduce new fishes that are only available at specific regions with different depths, which can also be integrated within the [Angler](https://terraria.fandom.com/wiki/Angler)'s quests. - ❌
## 4.9.5 Looping
The seamap acts as a 2D globe, which means if the player goes over one of the edges they will just come back to the other. This may provide shortcuts and further enhance the immersion of the map. - ❌

## 4.10. Critters
* **Crickets**: Crickets spawn on forest biomes, and will usually only hop around when the player is nearby. They emit cricket ambient sounds. Can be used as bait. - ❌

* **Woodpeckers**: Woodpeckers fly around the world, going from tree to tree. They may damage trees while pecking them, but never enough to make them fall. - ✔️

* **Hummingbirds**: Hummingbirds behave similarly to Woodpeckers, except they go from flower to flower, instead of tree to tree. Small flowers such as grass and herbs don't count, as they're usually in large groups. - ❌

* **Puffins**: Puffins are cute little birds that actually exist in real life. They look similar to a penguin, but also like a seagull. They may fly around and dive on water as an attempt for hunting. They can interact with boids. - ❌

* **Tarantulas**: Tarantulas are spiders, creepy ones. They act as a regular critter, except they can climb on tiles on any direction. Can be used as bait. Can be turned into a pet. - ❌

* **Chameleon**: Chameleons will try to blend in the environment and act as a regular critter. They are usually found in tree branches. Can be used as bait. - ❌

* **Hermit Crab**: Hermit Crabs are tiny little creatures that behave as regular critters. - ❌

* **Fleshworm**: Fleshworms are regular worms, except theyre a stronger bait and emit blood effects. - ❌
  
* **Crimson Wisp**: Wisps will guide you to nearby crimson hearts, taking a valid path and not going through tiles. - ❌

* **Corruption Wisp**: Corruption Wisps will guide you to nearby corruption orbs, taking a valid path and not going through tiles. - ❌

### 4.13.1 Armor
* **Pieces**
  - Scarlet Kabuto: Resembles a "samurai helmet." The melee headgear.
  - Scarlet Mengu: Resembles an armored kabuki mask that covers most of the face, but not the back of the player's head. The ranged headgear. - ❌
  - Scarlet Kasa: Resembles the typical asian conical hat, with a strap going around the player's head. The mage headgear. - ❌
  - Scarlet Hachimaki: Resembles a band around the forehead of the player. The summoner headgear. - ❌
  - Scarlet Battle Kimono: Resembles a traditional kimono colored red with gray "ropes/straps." Covers the player's chest and legs. - ❌

* **Bonus**: Summons a big oni mask in front of the player. Attacking enemies would cause arm projections to swing weapons like tetsubos, naginatas, etc, at the target
### 4.13.2 Gear
* **Scarlet Kuragisama**: Swung like a whip, but wraps around the target. Click again to forcefully bring it back, dealing a lot of damage from the wrapped enemy in the process. - ❌

* **Scarlet Saihai**: Opens a talisman UI selection, used to choose what minions to create. Each talisman only takes up half a minion slot. Clicking on a minion option consumes all talismans to summon a spirit with strength according to the amount of talismans consumed. - ❌
  - One talisman: Bird
  - Two to three talismans: Crane
  - Four to five talismans: Tanuki
  - Six to seven talismans: Kitsune
  - Eight or more: Dragon (Any more talismans are consumed to give it segments)
