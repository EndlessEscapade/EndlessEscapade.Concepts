# Endless Escapade - v0.1
> Beta

The initial release of the mod will feature plenty of mechanic reworks and new content. Despite not aiming to implement the Seamap and its islands, the version will still allow for players to feel what the mod envisions so far.

## Mechanics

The mod may or may not eventually rework many of the game's mechanics depending on whether it will benefit us or not. For now, swimming, arrow transformations and shell pile extractination are some of them.

### Swimming
The new swimming rework will completely modify the way the mechanic currently works by introducing omnidirectional movement, which consequently provides far more exploration and locomotion. Visually, the arms and legs of the player will also be adjusted to match the movement.
