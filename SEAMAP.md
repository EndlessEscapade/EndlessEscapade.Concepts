# Map
The Seamap acts as a globe, meaning that if you go around the edges you will simply loop it around, instead of being stuck on an invisible box collision.
## Anchoring
The boat can anchor at any point of the Seamap, regardless of whether they're in an island or not. This can be effectively used for fishing at different regions and overall exploring procedurally generated segments.
# Mini Islands
While not being as large as the main islands like the Coral Reefs or the Jade Islands, mini islands are meant to be scattered around zones to fill in empty gaps and overall provide more exploration and immersion through the seamap.
# Zones
## Glacier Zone
A cold weathered zone, filled with icebergs and ice continents. Icebergs will damage the crew's ship if they dont dodge it. Ice continents are explorable with a generation of igloos, damaged structures, and a generally plain surface of ice, with a few remnants of previous ice mountains.
### Mini Islands
* Penguin Continent: A small island unique from the regular ice continents. This island is filled with a local village of penguins. You can trade fish with penguins for a wide variety of new loot, similarly to how Piglins from Minecraft work.
## Tempered Zone
A tempered weathered zone, home for whirlpools and rocky mountainous continents. Whirlpools will attempt to drag and damage the crew's ship if they dont resist against it or avoid it while travelling. Mountainous continents are explorable as the usual, with a unique generation of valleys and mountains.
### Mini Islands
* Moyai Marsh
### Main Islands
* Goblin Fort
* Jade Islands
## Tropical Zone
A hot weathered zone, replenished of hurricanes and tropical islands full of fauna. Hurricanes will act as a counter part to the whirlpools, so instead of pulling you towards them they will do the exact opposite, they will push you away stopping you from getting into your final destination. Regular islands are generally filled with fauna and flora, being similar to the Amazon from real life.
### Main Islands
* Coral Reefs
* Volcano
